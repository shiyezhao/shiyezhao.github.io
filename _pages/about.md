I am an Associate Researcher at the [Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC)](https://www.jamstec.go.jp/j/), with a long-lasting passion for understanding the dispersal and impacts of both anthropogenic and natural particulate matter in the ocean. My research focuses on: a) developing a mechanistic understanding of how plastic particles of varying sizes travel from the sea surface to the seafloor, and how this affects oceanic servicesâ€”particularly the role of plastics in marine carbon sequestration; b) exploring the interactions between marine microbes and plastic debris or associated leachates, alongside natural particle influxes such as pumice, to assess how these inputs alter marine ecosystems; c) investigating the physical and chemical drivers behind plastic fragmentation and redistribution, including the influence of estuarine fronts and mesoscale eddies.<br>
I take an interdisciplinary approach, combining tools and techniques from optical spectroscopy, metagenomics, photochemistry, and marine particle chemistry. My fieldwork spans the global ocean, including participation in international research cruises and deep-sea dives aboard the human-occupied submersible Shinkai 6500. I am committed to translating my research into actionable insights by engaging with regional and local networks to support evidence-based policy and marine resource management.<br>
In my leisure time, I cherish spending time with my family and enjoy staying active through hiking, bicycling, and playing volleyball/basketball.

If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to get in touch. For those outside Japan, Japan offers both short-term and long-term programs to support international students, as well as early-career and senior scientists. I encourage you to explore opportunities, such as the [Sakura Science Exchange Program](https://ssp.jst.go.jp/en/) and the [JSPS Fellowships](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-inv/index.html).
