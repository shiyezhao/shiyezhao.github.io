excerpt: "**Pelagic microplastics in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre: A prevalent anthropogenic component of the particulate organic carbon pool** <br>This [work](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/3/pgad070/7073714) found that Microplastics (334 #/m³; 84.5% <100 µm) are pervasive in the eastern North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, with exponential decline in the upper 500 m and deep accumulation. The biological carbon pump likely drives their vertical redistribution, influencing organic carbon export. Radiocarbon-depleted MPs may alter deep ocean 14C signals, highlighting their role in shaping particulate dynamics."
