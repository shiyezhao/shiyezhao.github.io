excerpt: "**Accumulation, transformation and transport of microplastics in estuarine fronts** <br>This [work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00349-x) highlights how estuarine fronts concentrate microplastics through physical, geochemical, and biological interactions. Turbulence and particle mixing enhance microplastic transformation and ecosystem impact. These hotspots may offer targets for mitigation and deepen understanding of plastic fate along the landâ€“sea continuum. <br/><img src='/images/NREE.png'>"
