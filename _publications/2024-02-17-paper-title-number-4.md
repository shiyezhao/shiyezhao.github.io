excerpt: "**Accumulation, transformation and transport of microplastics in estuarine fronts** <br>In this [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c03592), we identify molecular signatures of DOM from plastic incubations using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Light exposure produced 319–705 photoproducts, compared to 0–12 in the dark, including oxygenated compounds. Photoproduct H/C ratios reflected those of the parent polymers, linking DOM composition to plastic stoichiometry. These results show that photochemistry alone can generate hundreds of diverse compounds from simple polymers. <br/><img src='/images/UV.png'>"
