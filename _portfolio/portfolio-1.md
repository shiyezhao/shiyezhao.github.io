excerpt: "**The Ecology Role of PlastiSphere** <br>Plastic marine debris (PMD) is a global pollutant now found in every marine ecosystem globally. Predicted to dramatically increase over the next decade, PMD provides a surface for microbial colonization in areas where substrate surfaces are rare. Upon entering seawater, plastics are colonized by microorganisms on a scale of minutes, forming biofilms or plastisphere microbial communities. In this project, we explore the ecological roles of plastic-associated microbial assemblages in different areas: 1) the impacts of allochthonous biogenic factors in the plastisphere, such as non-indigenous species and antibiotic resistant genes, on the endemic ecosystem; 2) how biofilm biomass carried by plastics, as a foreign carbon source, influences the energy flux in marine ecosystems and factors determining the quality of epiplastic biomass and potential effects on the organisms that graze it. <br/><img src='/images/Plastisphere.png'>"
