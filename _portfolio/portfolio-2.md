title: "Microplastics in the Ocean's Interior"
excerpt: "Globally, trillions of plastic pieces float in our oceans, representing an unprecedented environmental challenge. Up to 23 million tonnes of plastic debris enter aquatic ecosystems annually, with microplastics (MP, 1 um to 5 mm in size) as the major disintegration products. Despite their significant presence, tracking MP below the ocean surface remains understudied. This project aims to understand: 1) MP abundance and distribution throughout the water column, from the sea floor to surface waters. 2) Oceanographic processes governing the downward transport of plastic particles and their environmental interactions. Through international collaborations, we collected particle samples at various depths from the World's Oceans using a combination of in-situ pumps, Manta nets, and multiple opening/closing nets. <br/><img src='/images/worldocean.png'>"
